# Customer-Segmentation
Machine Learning project using K-Means 
Mall Customer dataset 

This project is broken into two sections 
One: General data analysis and data visualization
Two: Machine Learning Model- K-Means to predict custoemr segments 

Observation:
Through our models we have identified how the mall can improve their marketing efforts to specific customer segments 
based on age, gender, income, and overall spending.  We've identified that the mall's primary customers are
women between 25-40yo with medium incomes.
